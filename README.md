# My Dotfiles

## What's in this?

* a module that sets upo the rose pine theme
* packeges for the rose pine theme
* a config for my laptop and desktop
* config files for various pieces of software

## What I still want to do

* add documentation for all of my config
* document what i have learned about nix along this entire process
* fully theme my desktop with custom widgets

## Resorces that I used

* [mynixos.com](https://mynixos.com) - documentation for nixpkgs and HomeManager options
* [flake-parts](https://flake.parts) - a useful flake that makes nix a bit easier imo
* [Practical Nix flake anatomy](https://vtimofeenko.com/posts/practical-nix-flake-anatomy-a-guided-tour-of-flake.nix/) - a great description of the flakes schema
* [fufexan/dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) I used this repo as a guidline for my recent changes, it also provides a lot of examples for nix config and flakes
